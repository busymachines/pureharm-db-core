# pureharm-db-core

See [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

## modules

The available modules are:

- `"com.busymachines" %% s"pureharm-db-core" % "0.5.0"`. Which has these as its main dependencies:
  - [pureharm-core-anomaly](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-core/releases) `0.3.0`
  - [pureharm-core-sprout](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-core/releases) `0.3.0`

## usage

To load `DBConnectionConfig` use your prefered config reading library. We highly encourage you to use [pureharm-config-ciris](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-config-ciris). Alternatively, you can use [pureharm-config](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-config), although we treat the usage of the `pureconfig` as legacy at this point.

Under construction. See [release notes](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-db-core/releases) and tests for examples.
