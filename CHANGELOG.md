# unreleased

# 0.5.0

This is the first release of the module that is available for Scala 3!

### :warning: breaking changes :warning:
- as per the `0.4.0` release notes, pureharm-config is no longer a dependency of this module. `DBConnectionConfig` now ought to be read in application code, using the strategy best suited for the project. You can depend on [pureharm-config](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-config) directly to have least migration impact, or ideally, migrate to using [pureharm-config-ciris](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-config-ciris).

### dependency upgrades

- [pureharm-core](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-core/releases) `0.3.0`

### internals
- bump scalafmt to `3.0.0-RC6` â€” from `2.7.5`
- bump sbt to `1.5.5`
- bump sbt-spiewak to `0.21.0`
- bump sbt-scalafmt to `2.4.3`

# 0.4.0

:warning: This is the last release that depends on [pureharm-config](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-config/releases). Please move config reading into user-code, you can easily do this by depending directly on [pureharm-config](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-config/releases), for source and config compat with existing code. Ideally migrate to [pureharm-config-ciris](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-config-ciris) instead.

### dependency upgrades

# 0.3.0

### dependency upgrades

- [pureharm-config](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-config/releases) `0.3.0`

# 0.2.0

## deprecations

- deprecate `DBConnectionConfig` companion object. Use [pureharm-config-ciris](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-config-ciris), or some other config library of your choice to read these values on your own terms.
- deprecate all methods in Repo that take multiple elements. Will be removed since API is extremely clunky, and will be pushed down to be DB specific.

### dependency upgrades

- [pureharm-core-anomaly](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-core/releases) `0.2.0`
- [pureharm-core-sprout](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-core/releases) `0.2.0`

- cross compiled to Scala 2.13 -- pending support for scala 3.0.0-RC1
- add `DBPort` to `DBConnectionConfig`

:warning: Removed deprecated methods :warning:

- removed deprecated `DAOAlgebra` traits
